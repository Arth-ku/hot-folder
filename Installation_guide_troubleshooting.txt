Fisrt of all need copy _internal folder, icon.ico, Split_Print_MultiApp.exe and sumatra (32/64 depends of your system). 
manually instalattion for sumatra not required! (don't install manually, only via app browser)
1) After copy go to the printers -> put in the field passw: 1234 
2) Make sure  you put in prefix 3 first symbol exactly how you send the files. like if it starts  PL_  you must put in 
the field prefix:  PL_ (save the caps), for SPL -> put SPL and etc. !!!ONLY 3 FIRST SYMBOLS!!!!
3) For 32 bit use Sumatra32, for 64 - sumatra 64. For check which architechture do you have go to cmd -> 
	wmic os get OSArchitecture
4) For check printers full name via cmd ->	
	wmic printer get name
5) Match prefix with printer
6) minimize the app (via press close button)
7) check if the icon moves to icon bar (should be wolf with yellow moon)
8) for totally close the app choose the icon and make a right-click for quite or expanding (show)
FOR TROUBLESHOOTING (only advanced users): 
* If you make new installation, always put the shortcut to startup folder.
* If you open under alredy running app - need close last one app (or you getting double print).
* If the print folder doesn't exist (C:\DatexLables or C:\DatexLabels\archive) you getting error messages below the app. 
* For RESET configuration this have two way, just edit via printers (settings in app) or delete/edit .json file. 
* If you see errors with PREFIX, make sure u use caps and provide 3 symbol. After go to the .json file and check for 
visible errors, if still not working, delete .json file and re-open the app for make new setup.
